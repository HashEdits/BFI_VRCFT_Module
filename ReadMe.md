# BFI VRCFT Module üß†

A VRCFT module that let's you control VRCFT avatars using BFI expression actions controlled by your brain üß†

## How to use ü§î

### 1 - Make sure you have configured your supported expressions based on your trained actions :

`config.json` must be in the same folder as the module and is used to define which expressions you have trained and which action number it's assigned to and it's overhall weight.

Here's an exemple of a `config.json` supporting all of the supported expressions thus far:

```
{
  "supportedexpressions": {
    "eyeclosed": {
      "id": 1,
      "weight": 1.0
    },
    "smile": {
      "id": 2,
      "weight": 1.0
    },
    "frown": {
      "id": 3,
      "weight": 1.0
    },
    "anger": {
      "id": 4,
      "weight": 1.0
    },
    "cringe": {
      "id": 5,
      "weight": 1.0
    },
    "cheekpuff": {
      "id": 6,
      "weight": 1.0
    },
    "apeshape": {
      "id": 7,
      "weight": 1.0
    }
  },
  "ip": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8999,
  "timouttime": 3.0
}
```

[Here's BFI's documentation](https://github.com/ChilloutCharles/BrainFlowsIntoVRChat/wiki/Action-Classification-Instructions) on how to train your own actions

### 2 - Launch BFI to output to your configured port üí®

Here's the command to launch BFI with the right launch option if you leave the port on the default setting:

`python .\main.py ----osc-port 8999`

>Using an OSC mixer is recomended to remain compatibility with your BFI parameters compatible avatar

‚ö†Ô∏èThe port can be configured at the bottom of `config.json`

### 3 - Go to VRCFT's modules registery tab, click the `+` button and select the latest release of the module üìÅ


### 4 - Launch VRCFT ‚úîÔ∏è
