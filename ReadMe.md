# BFI VRCFT Module üß†

A VRCFT module that let's you control VRCFT avatars using BFI expression actions controlled by your brain üß†

## How to use ü§î

### 1 - Make sure you have configured your supported expressions based on your trained actions :

`expressions.json` must be in the same folder as the module and is used to define which expressions you have trained and which action number it's assigned to.

Here's an exemple of a `expressions.json` supporting all of the supported expressions thus far:

```
{
    "supportedexpressions": {
        "eyeclosed": {
            "id": 1,
            "weight": 1.0
        },
        "smile": {
            "id": 2,
            "weight": 1.0
        },
        "frown": {
            "id": 3,
            "weight": 1.0
        },
        "anger": {
            "id": 4,
            "weight": 1.0
        },
        "cringe": {
            "id": 5,
            "weight": 1.0
        },
        "cheekpuff": {
            "id": 6,
            "weight": 1.0
        },
        "apeshape": {
            "id": 7,
            "weight": 1.0
        }
    }
}
```
